# Environment Initiation and Setup
This lecture note introduces the environment initiation ans setup before working with

PyTorch (`torch`) can be installed and used on Windows platforms. Window 7 or greater are required, but Window 10 or greater are recommended.

## Setup with Terminal

### CUDA
According to [NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone#:~:text=CUDA%C2%AE%20is%20a%20parallel,harnessing%20the%20power%20of%20GPUs.), CUDAÂ® is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs). With CUDA, developers are able to dramatically speed up computing applications by harnessing the power of GPUs. In brief, CUDAs are commonly used for computing.

In AI and AI-related fields, CUDA is pivotal for its capabilities in accelerating a huge number of computations, such as working with PyTorch.

### Installing with `pip`

For the most appropriate version, please access [PyTorch | Get Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#windows-installation), then scroll down until you see the table as below.
